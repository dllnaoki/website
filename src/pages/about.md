Hello! This page is all about me. Written by me. Quite meta.

I currently live in Shenzhen. I've been in GuangGong for over 6 years. It's the city that never sleeps, but that works for us.

During the day, I'm a Front Engineer, Sometimes I also take on the roles of product manager and backend architecture. You know, startups are always "understaffed" (smile). It's an overused expression, but some days it truly feels as simple as that.
